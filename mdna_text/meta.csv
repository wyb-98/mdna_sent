2024-03-31,"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsYou should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with our condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and with our audited consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In addition to our historical condensed consolidated financial information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates, and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, particularly in Part II, Item 1A, ""Risk Factors."" For a discussion of limitations in the measurement of our Family metrics, see the section entitled ""Limitations of Key Metrics and Other Data"" in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.To supplement our condensed consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), we present revenue on a constant currency basis, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. Revenue on a constant currency basis is presented in the section entitled ""—Revenue—Foreign Exchange Impact on Revenue."" To calculate revenue on a constant currency basis, we translated revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2024 using the prior year's monthly exchange rates for our settlement or billing currencies other than the U.S. dollar.This non-GAAP financial measure is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. This measure may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies, limiting its usefulness for comparison purposes. Moreover, presentation of revenue on a constant currency basis is provided for year-over-year comparison purposes, and investors should be cautioned that the effect of changing foreign currency exchange rates has an actual effect on our operating results. We believe this non-GAAP financial measure provides investors with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business, enables comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance, and allows for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business.Executive Overview of First Quarter ResultsOur mission is to give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together. Our financial results and key Family metrics for the first quarter of 2024 are set forth below. Total revenue for the first quarter of 2024 was $36.46 billion, an increase of 27% compared to the first quarter of 2023, due to an increase in advertising revenue. Ad impressions delivered across our Family of Apps in the first quarter of 2024 increased 20% year-over-year, and our average price per ad in the first quarter of 2024 increased 6% year-over-year. Consolidated and Segment ResultsWe report our financial results for our two reportable segments: Family of Apps (FoA) and Reality Labs (RL). FoA includes Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, WhatsApp, and other services. RL includes our virtual, augmented, and mixed reality related consumer hardware, software, and content.28Table of Contents•Net income was $12.37 billion, with diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $4.71 for the three months ended March 31, 2024. •Capital expenditures, including principal payments on finance leases, were $6.72 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2024.•Share repurchases were $14.64 billion of our Class A common stock and dividends payments were $1.27 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2024.•Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were $58.12 billion as of March 31, 2024.•Effective tax rate was 13% for the three months ended March 31, 2024.•Headcount was 69,329 as of March 31, 2024, a decrease of 10% year-over-year. Family of Apps Metrics•Family daily active people (DAP) was 3.24 billion on average for March 2024, an increase of 7% year-over-year.•Ad impressions delivered across our Family of Apps in the first quarter of 2024 increased by 20% year-over-year.•Average price per ad in the first quarter of 2024 increased by 6% year-over-year.Developments in AdvertisingSubstantially all of our revenue is currently generated from advertising on Facebook and Instagram. We rely on targeting and measurement tools that incorporate data signals from user activity on websites and services that we do not control, as well as signals generated within our products, in order to deliver relevant and effective ads to our users. Our advertising revenue has been, and we expect will continue to be, adversely affected by reduced marketer spending as a result of limitations on our ad targeting and measurement tools arising from changes to the regulatory environment and third-party mobile operating systems and browsers.In particular, legislative and regulatory developments such as the General Data Protection Regulation, including its evolving interpretation through decisions of the Court of Justice of the European Union, ePrivacy Directive, European Digital Services Act, Digital Markets Act, and U.S. state privacy laws including the California Consumer Privacy Act, as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act, have impacted our ability to use data signals in our ad products, and we expect these and other developments will have further impact in the future. As a result, we have implemented, and we will continue to implement, whether voluntarily or otherwise, changes to our products and user data practices, which reduce our ability to effectively target and measure ads. For example, in response to regulatory developments in Europe, we announced our plans to change the legal basis for behavioral advertising on Facebook and Instagram in the EU, European Economic Area, and Switzerland from ""legitimate interests"" to ""consent,"" and began offering users in the region a ""subscription for no ads"" alternative. We are engaging with regulators on our consent model. In addition, mobile operating system and browser providers, such as Apple and Google, have implemented product changes and/or announced future plans to limit the ability of websites and application developers to collect and use these signals to target and measure advertising. For example, in 2021, Apple made certain changes to its products and data use policies in connection with changes to its iOS operating system that reduce our and other iOS developers' ability to target and measure advertising, which has negatively impacted, and we expect will continue to negatively impact, the size of the budgets marketers are willing to commit to us and other advertising platforms.To mitigate these developments, we are continually working to evolve our advertising systems to improve the performance of our ad products. We are developing privacy enhancing technologies to deliver relevant ads and measurement capabilities while reducing the amount of personal information we process, including by relying more on anonymized or aggregated third-party data. In addition, we are developing tools that enable marketers to share their data into our systems, as well as ad products that generate more valuable signals within our apps. More broadly, we also continue to innovate our advertising tools to help marketers prepare campaigns and connect with consumers, including developing growing formats such as Reels ads and our business messaging ad products. Across all of these efforts, we are making significant investments in artificial intelligence (AI), including generative AI, to improve our delivery, targeting, and measurement capabilities. Further, we are focused on driving onsite conversions in our business messaging ad products by developing new features and scaling existing features.29Table of ContentsWe are also engaging with others across our industry to explore the possibility of new open standards for the private and secure processing of data for advertising purposes. We believe our ongoing improvements to ad targeting and measurement are continuing to drive improved results for advertisers. However, we expect that some of these efforts will be long-term initiatives, and that the legislative, regulatory and platform developments described above will continue to adversely impact our advertising revenue for the foreseeable future.Other Business and Macroeconomic ConditionsOther global and regional business, macroeconomic, and geopolitical conditions also have had, and we believe will continue to have, an impact on our user growth and engagement and advertising revenue. In particular, we believe advertising budgets have been pressured from time to time by factors such as inflation, rising interest rates, and related market uncertainty, which has led to reduced marketer spending. While we saw improvement in business and macroeconomic conditions in recent periods, continued business, macroeconomic, and geopolitical uncertainty remains, which could impact our financial results in future periods. In addition, competitive products and services have reduced some users' engagement with our products and services. We are investing in Reels and in AI initiatives across our products, including our AI-powered discovery engine to recommend relevant content, which we have already seen results in improved user engagement and monetization of our products. While Reels is growing in usage, it monetizes at a lower rate than our Feed and Stories products and we expect it will continue to monetize at a lower rate for the foreseeable future. We also have seen fluctuations and declines in the size of our active user base in one or more regions from time to time. For example, in connection with the war in Ukraine, access to Facebook and Instagram was restricted in Russia and the services were then prohibited by the Russian government, which continued to adversely affect user growth and engagement in the first quarter of 2024. These trends adversely affected advertising revenue in the first quarter of 2024, and we expect will continue to affect our advertising revenue in the foreseeable future.Although we regularly evaluate a variety of sources to understand trends in our advertising revenue, we do not have perfect visibility into the factors driving advertiser spending decisions and our assessments involve complex judgments about what is driving advertising decisions across a large and diversified advertiser base across the globe. Trends impacting advertising spend are also dynamic and interrelated. As a result, it is difficult to identify with precision which advertiser spending decisions are attributable to which trends, and we are unable to quantify the exact impact that each trend had on our advertising revenue during the periods presented.Investment PhilosophyWe expect to continue to build on the discipline and habits that we developed in 2022 when we initiated several efforts to increase our operating efficiency, while still remaining focused on investing in significant opportunities. In the three months ended March 31, 2024, 81% of our total costs and expenses were recognized in FoA and 19% were recognized in RL. Our FoA investments include expenses relating to headcount, data centers, and technical infrastructure as part of our efforts to develop our apps and our advertising services. These efforts include significant investments in AI initiatives, including to recommend relevant content across our products, enhance our advertising tools, develop new products, and develop new features for existing products using generative AI. We are also making significant investments in our metaverse efforts, including developing virtual, augmented, and mixed reality devices, software for social platforms, neural interfaces, and other foundational technologies for the metaverse. Our RL investments include expenses relating to technology development across these efforts. Many of our RL investments are directed toward long-term, cutting-edge research and development for products for the metaverse that may only be fully realized in the next decade. During the three months ended March 31, 2024, our RL segment reduced our overall operating profit by approximately $3.85 billion, and we expect our RL operating losses to increase meaningfully in 2024. We expect this will be a complex, evolving, and long-term initiative, and our ability to support our metaverse efforts is dependent on generating sufficient profits from other areas of our business. We are investing now because we believe this is the next chapter of the internet and will unlock monetization opportunities for businesses, developers, and creators, including around advertising, hardware, and digital goods.30Table of ContentsTrends in Our Revenue by User Geography We calculate our revenue by user geography based on our estimate of the geography in which ad impressions are delivered, virtual and digital goods are purchased, or consumer hardware products are shipped. The geography of our users affects our revenue and financial results. Our revenue in regions such as United States & Canada and Europe is relatively higher primarily due to the size and maturity of those online and mobile advertising markets, and ad impression growth is mostly in geographies that monetize at lower rates, such as Asia-Pacific and Rest of World. In the first quarter of 2024, revenue increased by 21% in United States & Canada, 34% in Europe, 26% in Asia-Pacific, and 42% in Rest of World, in each case relative to the same period in 2023.-  Note: Non-advertising revenue includes RL revenue generated from the delivery of consumer hardware products and FoA Other revenue, which consists of revenue from WhatsApp Business Platform, net fees we receive from developers using our Payments infrastructure, and revenue from various other sources.Our revenue by user geography in the charts above is geographically apportioned based on our estimation of the geographic location of our users when they perform a revenue-generating activity. This allocation differs from our revenue disaggregated by geography disclosure in Note 2 — Revenue in our condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1, ""Financial Statements"" where revenue is geographically apportioned based on the addresses of our customers.31Table of ContentsTrends in Our Family MetricsThe numbers for our key Family metrics, our DAP and average revenue per person (ARPP), do not include users on our other products unless they would otherwise qualify as DAP based on their other activities on our Family products. Trends in the number of people in our community affect our revenue and financial results by influencing the number of ads we are able to show, the value of our ads to marketers, as well as our expenses and capital expenditures. Substantially all of our daily active people (as defined below) access our Family products on mobile devices.•Daily Active People (DAP). We define a daily active person as a registered and logged-in user of Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and/or WhatsApp (collectively, our ""Family"" of products) who visited at least one of these Family products through a mobile device application or using a web or mobile browser on a given day. We do not require people to use a common identifier or link their accounts to use multiple products in our Family, and therefore must seek to attribute multiple user accounts within and across products to individual people. Our calculations of DAP rely upon complex techniques, algorithms, and machine learning models that seek to estimate the underlying number of unique people using one or more of these products, including by matching user accounts within an individual product and across multiple products when we believe they are attributable to a single person, and counting such group of accounts as one person. As these techniques and models require significant judgment, are developed based on internal reviews of limited samples of user accounts, and are calibrated against user survey data, there is necessarily some margin of error in our estimates. We view DAP as a measure of engagement across our products. For additional information, see the section entitled ""Limitations of Key Metrics and Other Data"" in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. --Note: We report the numbers of DAP as specific amounts, but these numbers are estimates of the numbers of unique people using our products and are subject to statistical variances and errors. While we expect the error margin for these estimates to vary from period to period, we estimate that such margin generally will be approximately 3% of our worldwide DAP. At our scale, it is very difficult to attribute multiple user accounts within and across products to individual people, and it is possible that the actual numbers of unique people using our products may vary significantly from our estimates, potentially beyond our estimated error margins. For additional information, see the section entitled ""Limitations of Key Metrics and Other Data"" in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. In the third quarter of 2022, we updated our Family metrics calculations to maintain calibration of our models against recent user survey data, and we estimate such update contributed an aggregate of approximately 30 million DAP to our reported worldwide DAP in September 2022. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2023, our Family metrics no longer include Messenger Kids users.Worldwide DAP increased 7% to 3.24 billion on average during March 2024 from 3.02 billion during March 2023.32Table of Contents•Average Revenue Per Person (ARPP). Our Family of Apps (FoA) revenue represents the substantial majority of our total revenue. We define ARPP as our FoA revenue during a given quarter, divided by the average of the number of DAP at the beginning and end of the quarter.  Note: We updated our definition of ARPP beginning in the first quarter of 2024 and have recast ARPP in prior periods for comparative purposes.During the first quarter of 2024, worldwide ARPP was $11.20, an increase of 18% from the first quarter of 2023.33Table of ContentsTrends in Our Ad Impressions and Average Price Per Ad•Ad Impressions. Our advertising revenue is generated by displaying ad products on Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and third-party mobile applications. Impressions are considered delivered when an ad is displayed to a user.  Note: Our ad impressions growth by user geography in the charts above is geographically apportioned based on our estimation of the geographic location of our users when an ad impression is delivered.34Table of Contents•Average Price Per Ad. We calculate average price per ad as total advertising revenue divided by the number of ads delivered.  Note: Our average price per ad growth by user geography in the charts above is geographically apportioned based on our estimation of the geographic location of our users when an ad impression is delivered.35Table of ContentsComponents of Results of OperationsRevenueFamily of Apps (FoA)Advertising. We generate substantially all of our revenue from advertising. Our advertising revenue is generated by displaying ad products on Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and third-party mobile applications. Marketers pay for ad products either directly or through their relationships with advertising agencies or resellers, based on the number of impressions delivered or the number of actions, such as clicks, taken by users. We recognize revenue from the display of impression-based ads in the contracted period in which the impressions are delivered. Impressions are considered delivered when an ad is displayed to a user. We recognize revenue from the delivery of action-based ads in the period in which a user takes the action the marketer contracted for. The number of ads we show is subject to methodological changes as we continue to evolve our ads business and the structure of our ads products. In particular, the ads we show may vary by product (for example, our video and Reels products are not currently monetized at the same rate as our Feed or Stories products), and from time to time we increase or decrease the number or frequency of ads we show as part of our product and monetization strategies. We calculate average price per ad as total advertising revenue divided by the number of ads delivered, representing the average price paid per ad by a marketer regardless of their desired objective such as impression or action. For advertising revenue arrangements where we are not the principal, we recognize revenue on a net basis.Other revenue. Other revenue consists of revenue from WhatsApp Business Platform, net fees we receive from developers using our Payments infrastructure and revenue from various other sources.Reality Labs (RL)RL revenue is generated from the delivery of consumer hardware products, such as Meta Quest, wearables, and related software and content.Cost of Revenue and Operating ExpensesCost of revenue. Our cost of revenue consists of expenses associated with the delivery and distribution of our products. These mainly include expenses related to the operation of our data centers and technical infrastructure, such as depreciation expense from servers, network infrastructure and buildings, as well as payroll and related expenses which include share-based compensation for employees on our operations teams, and energy and bandwidth costs. Cost of revenue also includes costs associated with partner arrangements, including traffic acquisition costs and credit card and other fees related to processing customer transactions; RL inventory costs, which consist of cost of products sold and estimated losses on non-cancelable contractual commitments; and content costs.Research and development. Research and development expenses consist mostly of payroll and related expenses which include share-based compensation, RL technology development costs, facilities-related costs for employees on our engineering and technical teams who are responsible for developing new products as well as improving existing products, as well as infrastructure cost and restructuring charges.Marketing and sales. Marketing and sales expenses consist mainly of marketing and promotional expenses as well as payroll and related expenses which include share-based compensation for our employees engaged in sales, sales support, marketing, business development, and customer service functions. Our marketing and sales expenses also include professional services such as content reviewers to support our community and product operations and restructuring charges.General and administrative. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of legal-related costs, which include estimated fines, settlements, or other losses in connection with legal and related matters, as well as other legal fees; payroll and related expenses which include share-based compensation for certain of our executives as well as our legal, finance, human resources, corporate communications and policy, and other administrative employees; other taxes, such as digital services taxes and other non-income-based tax levies; professional services and restructuring charges.36Table of ContentsResults of OperationsThe following table sets forth our condensed consolidated statements of income data (in millions):The following table sets forth our condensed consolidated statements of income data (as a percentage of revenue)(1): ____________________________________(1)    Percentages have been rounded for presentation purposes and may differ from unrounded results.37Table of ContentsRevenueThe following table sets forth our revenue by source and by segment:Family of AppsFoA revenue in the three months ended March 31, 2024 increased $7.71 billion, or 27%, compared to the same period in 2023. The increase was almost entirely driven by advertising revenue.AdvertisingAdvertising revenue in the three months ended March 31, 2024 increased $7.53 billion, or 27%, compared to the same period in 2023 due to increases in ad impressions delivered and average price per ad. During the three months ended March 31, 2024, ad impressions delivered increased by 20% as compared with an increase of 26% in the same period in 2023 as ad impressions grew in all regions, especially in Asia-Pacific and Rest of World. The increase in ad impressions delivered was primarily driven by an increase in users and their engagement on our products. During the three months ended March 31, 2024, the average price per ad increased by 6%, as compared with a decrease of 17% in the same period in 2023. The increase in average price per ad was driven by an increase in advertising demand which we believe is primarily due to ongoing improvements to our ad performance from our ad targeting and measurement tools. This increase was partially offset by a higher number of ad impressions delivered, especially in geographies and in products, such as Reels, that monetize at lower rates. Other factors are discussed in the section entitled ""—Executive Overview of First Quarter Results."" In addition, year-over-year advertising revenue growth in the three months ended March 31, 2024 was mainly driven by marketer spending in online commerce, gaming, as well as entertainment and media. We anticipate that future advertising revenue will be driven by a combination of price and ad impressions delivered. Other revenueFoA other revenue in the three months ended March 31, 2024 increased $175 million, or 85%, compared to the same period in 2023. The increase was primarily driven by WhatsApp Business Platform revenue.Reality LabsRL revenue in the three months ended March 31, 2024 increased $101 million, or 30%, compared to the same period in 2023. The increase in RL revenue was driven by a net increase in the volume of Meta Quest sales.Foreign Exchange Impact on RevenueChanges in foreign exchange rates had a favorable impact on our revenue in the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. If we had translated revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2024 using the prior year's monthly exchange rates for our settlement or billing currencies other than the U.S. dollar, our total revenue and advertising revenue would have been $36.35 billion and $35.53 billion, respectively. Using these constant rates, total revenue and advertising revenue would have been $106 million and $105 million lower than actual total revenue and advertising revenue, respectively, for the three months ended March 31, 2024. 38Table of ContentsCost of revenueCost of revenue in the three months ended March 31, 2024 increased $532 million, or 9%, compared to the same period in 2023. The increase was mostly from an increase in operational expenses related to our data centers and technical infrastructure which was partially offset by a decrease in RL inventory-related valuation adjustments.Research and developmentResearch and development expenses in the three months ended March 31, 2024 increased $597 million, or 6%, compared to the same period in 2023. The increase was mostly from higher payroll and related expenses and infrastructure costs, offset by a decrease in restructuring charges.See Note 3 — Restructuring in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1, of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information regarding restructuring charges.Marketing and salesMarketing and sales expenses in the three months ended March 31, 2024 decreased $480 million, or 16%, compared to the same period in 2023. The decrease was mainly due to decreases in restructuring charges, product and community operations expenses, and marketing and promotional expenses.See Note 3 — Restructuring in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1, of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information regarding restructuring charges.General and administrativeGeneral and administrative expenses in the three months ended March 31, 2024 increased $570 million, or 20%, compared to the same period in 2023. The increase was driven by higher legal-related costs, partially offset by a decrease in restructuring charges.39Table of ContentsSee Note 3 — Restructuring and Note 12 — Commitments and Contingencies in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1, of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information regarding restructuring charges and legal-related costs, respectively.Segment profitabilityThe following table sets forth income (loss) from operations by segment:Family of AppsFoA income from operations in the three months ended March 31, 2024 increased $6.44 billion, or 57%, compared to the same period in 2023. The increase in FoA income from operations was driven by higher advertising revenue which was partially offset by an increase in costs and expenses. The increase in the costs and expenses was due to increases in legal-related costs and operational expenses related to our data centers and technical infrastructure, offset by a decrease in restructuring charges.Reality LabsRL loss from operations in the three months ended March 31, 2024 decreased $146 million, or 4%, compared to the same period in 2023. The decrease in RL loss from operations was driven by an increase in RL revenue and a slight decrease in RL costs and expenses. The decrease in the costs and expenses was driven by lower RL inventory-related valuation adjustments and restructuring charges, offset by an increase in payroll and related costs. See Note 3 — Restructuring and Note 12 — Commitments and Contingencies in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1, of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information regarding restructuring charges and legal-related costs, respectively.Interest and other income, net____________________________________NM    - not meaningfulInterest and other income, net in the three months ended March 31, 2024 increased $285 million, or 356%, compared to the same period in 2023. The increase in interest income was due to a combination of higher balances and higher interest rates, compared to the same period in 2023. 40Table of ContentsProvision for income taxesOur provision for income taxes in the three months ended March 31, 2024 increased $216 million, or 14%, compared to the same period in 2023, due to an increase in income before provision for income taxes.Our effective tax rate decreased in the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to excess tax benefits recognized from share-based compensation. Effective Tax Rate Items. Our effective tax rate in the future will depend upon the proportion between the following items and income before provision for income taxes: U.S. tax benefits from foreign-derived intangible income, tax effects from share-based compensation, research tax credit, tax effects from capital losses not expected to be utilized, restructurings, settlement of tax contingency items, tax effects of changes in our business, and the effects of changes in tax law.The accounting for share-based compensation may increase or decrease our effective tax rate based upon the difference between our share-based compensation expense and the deductions taken on our tax return, which depend upon the stock price at the time of employee award vesting. If our stock price remains constant to the April 19, 2024 price, and absent any changes to our tax landscape, we expect our effective tax rate for the full year 2024 to be in the mid-teens. This includes the effects of the mandatory capitalization and amortization of research and development expenses incurred in 2024, as required by the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Act). The mandatory capitalization requirement increases our 2024 cash tax liabilities materially but also decreases our effective tax rate due to increasing the foreign-derived intangible income deduction. If the mandatory capitalization is deferred, our effective tax rate in 2024 could be higher when compared to current law and our cash tax liabilities could be lower.A number of countries have begun to enact legislation to implement the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development’s 15% global minimum tax regime with effect from January 1, 2024. We do not expect these changes to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements for 2024. We continue to evaluate the impacts of proposed and enacted legislation with respect to the global minimum tax regime in the jurisdictions we operate in. Our effective tax rate and cash tax payments could increase in future years as further jurisdictions enact legislation.See Note 14 — Income Taxes in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1, of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information regarding income tax contingencies.41Table of ContentsLiquidity and Capital ResourcesOur principal sources of liquidity are our cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, and cash generated from operations. Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities are comprised of cash on deposit with banks, time deposits, money market funds, U.S. government and agency securities, and investment grade corporate debt securities. As part of our cash management strategy, we concentrate cash deposits with large financial institutions and our investment holdings are in diversified highly rated securities. Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were $58.12 billion as of March 31, 2024, a decrease of $7.28 billion from December 31, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to $15.01 billion for repurchases of our Class A common stock, $6.72 billion for capital expenditures, including principal payments on finance leases, and $3.16 billion of taxes paid related to net share settlement of employee restricted stock unit (RSU) awards. These decreases were partially offset by $19.25 billion of cash generated from operations.The following table presents our cash flows (in millions):Cash Provided by Operating ActivitiesCash provided by operating activities during the three months ended March 31, 2024 mostly consisted of $12.37 billion net income adjusted for certain non-cash items, such as $3.56 billion of share-based compensation expense, and $3.37 billion of depreciation and amortization expense. The increase in cash flows from operating activities during the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, was due to an increase in cash collection from our customers driven by the increase in revenue, partially offset by higher operating spending.Cash Used in Investing ActivitiesCash used in investing activities during the three months ended March 31, 2024 mostly consisted of $6.40 billion of net purchases of property and equipment as we continued to invest in servers, data centers, and network infrastructure, and $2.26 billion of net purchases of marketable debt securities. The increase in cash used in investing activities during the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, was mainly due to an increase in purchases of marketable debt securities.We anticipate making capital expenditures of approximately $35 billion to $40 billion in 2024.Cash Used in Financing ActivitiesCash used in financing activities during the three months ended March 31, 2024 mostly consisted of $15.01 billion for repurchases of our Class A common stock, $3.16 billion of taxes paid related to net share settlement of RSUs, and $1.27 billion of cash dividends paid for our common stock. The increase in cash used in financing activities during the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, was mostly due to an increase in cash paid for repurchases of our Class A common stock, an increase in taxes paid related to net share settlement of employee RSU awards, and the dividends payments that began in March 2024.42Table of ContentsMaterial Cash RequirementsWe currently anticipate that our available funds and cash flow from operations and financing activities will be sufficient to meet our operational cash needs and fund our share repurchases and dividends payments for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. We continuously evaluate our liquidity and capital resources, including our access to external capital, to ensure we can finance our future capital requirements.Leases and Contractual CommitmentsOur operating lease obligations mostly include offices, data centers and colocations. Our facilities consolidation restructuring efforts did not materially change our operating lease obligations. Our contractual commitments are primarily related to our investments in servers, network infrastructure, and consumer hardware products in Reality Labs.Long-term DebtAs of March 31, 2024, we had outstanding long-term debt in the form of senior unsecured notes for an aggregate principal amount of $18.50 billion. These notes were issued in multiple series, which mature from 2027 through 2063. Short-term and long-term future interest payments obligations as of March 31, 2024 were $848 million and $16.19 billion, respectively. Capital Return ProgramOur board of directors has authorized a share repurchase program of our Class A common stock, which commenced in January 2017 and does not have an expiration date. During the three months ended March 31, 2024, we repurchased and subsequently retired 34 million shares of our Class A common stock for an aggregate amount of $14.64 billion. As of March 31, 2024, $66.40 billion remained available and authorized for repurchases.On February 1, 2024, we announced the initiation of our first ever cash dividend program. During the three months ended March 31, 2024, we paid a cash dividend of $0.50 per share of Class A and Class B common stock, totaling to $1.27 billion. Subject to legally available funds and future declaration by our board of directors, we currently intend to continue to pay a quarterly cash dividend on our outstanding common stock.TaxesCash paid for income taxes was $630 million during the three months ended March 31, 2024. Subsequently, we also made a $3.77 billion U.S. federal income tax payment in April 2024, including a $575 million installment payment related to a one-time transition tax payable incurred as a result of the Tax Act.Our long-term income taxes includes $7.13 billion related to the uncertain tax positions as of March 31, 2024. Due to uncertainties in the timing of the completion of tax audits, the timing of the resolution of these positions is uncertain and we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments.Loss ContingenciesWe are involved in legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory, tax or government inquiries and investigations. We record a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a liability has been incurred, and that the amount can be reasonably estimated. If we determine there is a reasonable possibility that we may incur a loss and the loss or range of loss can be estimated, we disclose the possible loss in the accompanying notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements to the extent material. Significant judgment is required to determine both probability and the estimated amount of loss. Such matters are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control. Should any of these estimates and assumptions change or prove to be incorrect, it could have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.See Note 8 — Leases, Note 10 — Long-term Debt, Note 12 — Commitments and Contingencies, Note 13 — Stockholders' Equity, and Note 14 — Income Taxes in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1, and ""Legal Proceedings"" contained in Part II, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information regarding leases and contractual commitments, debt, capital return program, taxes, and contingencies, respectively.43Table of ContentsCritical Accounting EstimatesOur condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. Our actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Refer to ""Critical Accounting Estimates"" contained in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 for a complete discussion of our critical accounting estimates. There have been no material changes to our critical accounting estimates since our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023."
2023-09-30,"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsYou should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with our condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and with our audited consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In addition to our historical condensed consolidated financial information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates, and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, particularly in Part II, Item 1A, ""Risk Factors."" For a discussion of limitations in the measurement of certain of our community metrics, see the section entitled ""Limitations of Key Metrics and Other Data"" in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.To supplement our condensed consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), we present revenue on a constant currency basis, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. Revenue on a constant currency basis is presented in the section entitled ""—Revenue—Foreign Exchange Impact on Revenue."" To calculate revenue on a constant currency basis, we translated revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 using the prior year's monthly exchange rates for our settlement or billing currencies other than the U.S. dollar.This non-GAAP financial measure is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. This measure may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies, limiting its usefulness for comparison purposes. Moreover, presentation of revenue on a constant currency basis is provided for year-over-year comparison purposes, and investors should be cautioned that the effect of changing foreign currency exchange rates has an actual effect on our operating results. We believe this non-GAAP financial measure provides investors with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business, enables comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance, and allows for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business.Executive Overview of Third Quarter ResultsOur mission is to give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together. Our financial results and key community metrics for the third quarter of 2023 are set forth below. Our total revenue for the third quarter of 2023 was $34.15 billion, an increase of 23% compared to the third quarter of 2022, due to an increase in advertising revenue. Revenue on a constant currency basis would have increased 21% compared to the third quarter of 2022. Ad impressions delivered across our Family of Apps increased 31% year-over-year in the third quarter of 2023, partially offset by a 6% year-over-year decrease in our average price per ad.Income from operations for the third quarter of 2023 was $13.75 billion, an increase of $8.08 billion, or 143%, compared to the third quarter of 2022, due to an increase in advertising revenue and a decrease in costs and expenses such as legal-related costs and marketing and promotional expenses. 33Table of ContentsConsolidated and Segment ResultsWe report our financial results for our two reportable segments: Family of Apps (FoA) and Reality Labs (RL). FoA includes Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, WhatsApp, and other services. RL includes our augmented and virtual reality related consumer hardware, software, and content.•Net income was $11.58 billion, with diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $4.39 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. •Costs and expenses were $20.40 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2023.•Capital expenditures, including principal payments on finance leases, were $6.76 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2023.•Effective tax rate was 17% for the three months ended September 30, 2023.•Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were $61.12 billion as of September 30, 2023.•Long-term debt was $18.38 billion as of September 30, 2023.•Headcount was 66,185 as of September 30, 2023, a decrease of 24% year-over-year. A substantial majority of the employees impacted by the layoffs are no longer included in our reported headcount as of September 30, 2023. RestructuringBeginning in 2022, we initiated several measures to pursue greater efficiency and to realign our business and strategic priorities. As of September 30, 2023, we have substantially completed planned employee layoffs while continuing to assess facilities consolidation and data center restructuring initiatives.A summary of our restructuring charges, including subsequent adjustments, for the three months ended September 30, 2023 by major activity type is as follows (in millions):During the three months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded total restructuring charges of $305 million under our FoA segment, and $75 million under our RL segment.We expect to incur total pre-tax restructuring charges of approximately $3.5 billion during the full-year 2023, of which $2.30 billion was recognized during the nine months ended September 30, 2023.34Table of ContentsSee Note 3 — Restructuring in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1, of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information regarding restructuring charges.Family of Apps Metrics•Family daily active people (DAP) was 3.14 billion on average for September 2023, an increase of 7% year-over-year.•Family monthly active people (MAP) was 3.96 billion as of September 30, 2023, an increase of 7% year-over-year.•Facebook daily active users (DAUs) were 2.09 billion on average for September 2023, an increase of 5% year-over-year.•Facebook monthly active users (MAUs) were 3.05 billion as of September 30, 2023, an increase of 3% year-over-year.•Ad impressions delivered across our Family of Apps in the third quarter of 2023 increased by 31% year-over-year, and the average price per ad in the third quarter of 2023 decreased by 6% year-over-year.Developments in AdvertisingSubstantially all of our revenue is currently generated from advertising on Facebook and Instagram. We rely on targeting and measurement tools that incorporate data signals from user activity on websites and services that we do not control in order to deliver relevant and effective ads to our users. Our advertising revenue has been, and we expect will continue to be, adversely affected by reduced marketer spending as a result of limitations on our ad targeting and measurement tools arising from changes to the regulatory environment and third-party mobile operating systems and browsers.In particular, legislative and regulatory developments such as the General Data Protection Regulation, including its evolving interpretation through decisions of the Court of Justice of the European Union, ePrivacy Directive, the European Digital Services Act, and U.S. state privacy laws including the California Consumer Privacy Act, as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act, have impacted our ability to use data signals in our ad products, and we expect these and other developments such as the Digital Markets Act will have further impact in the future. As a result, we have implemented, and we will continue to implement, whether voluntarily or otherwise, changes to our products and user data practices, which reduce our ability to effectively target and measure ads. For example, in response to regulatory developments in Europe, we announced plans to change the legal basis for behavioral advertising on Facebook and Instagram in the EU, EEA, and Switzerland from ""legitimate interests"" to ""consent,"" and are engaging with regulators on our proposed consent model. In addition, mobile operating system and browser providers, such as Apple and Google, have implemented product changes and/or announced future plans to limit the ability of websites and application developers to collect and use these signals to target and measure advertising. For example, in 2021, Apple made certain changes to its products and data use policies in connection with changes to its iOS operating system that reduce our and other iOS developers' ability to target and measure advertising, which has negatively impacted, and we expect will continue to negatively impact, the size of the budgets marketers are willing to commit to us and other advertising platforms.To mitigate these developments, we are continually working to evolve our advertising systems to improve the performance of our ad products. We are developing privacy enhancing technologies to deliver relevant ads and measurement capabilities while reducing the amount of personal information we process, including by relying more on anonymized or aggregated third-party data. In addition, we are developing tools that enable marketers to share their data into our systems, as well as ad products that generate more valuable signals within our apps. More broadly, we also continue to innovate our advertising tools to help marketers prepare campaigns and connect with consumers, including developing growing formats such as Reels ads and our business messaging ad products. Across all of these efforts, we are making significant investments in artificial intelligence (AI), including generative AI, to improve our delivery, targeting, and measurement capabilities. Further, we are focused on driving onsite conversions in our business messaging ad products by developing new features and scaling existing features.We are also engaging with others across our industry to explore the possibility of new open standards for the private and secure processing of data for advertising purposes. We believe our ongoing improvements to ad targeting and measurement are continuing to drive improved results for advertisers. However, we expect that some of these efforts will be long-term initiatives, and that the legislative, regulatory and platform developments described above will continue to adversely impact our advertising revenue for the foreseeable future.35Table of ContentsOther Business and Macroeconomic ConditionsOther global and regional business, macroeconomic, and geopolitical conditions also have had, and we believe will continue to have, an impact on our user growth and engagement and advertising revenue. In particular, we believe advertising budgets have been pressured from time to time by factors such as inflation, rising interest rates, and related market uncertainty, which has led to reduced marketer spending. While we saw improvement in business and macroeconomic conditions in the third quarter of 2023, continued business, macroeconomic, and geopolitical uncertainty remains, which could impact our financial results in future periods. In addition, competitive products and services have reduced some users' engagement with our products and services. In response to competitive pressures, we are investing in Reels and in AI initiatives across our products, including our AI-powered discovery engine to recommend relevant unconnected content, which we have already seen results in improved user engagement and monetization of our products. While Reels is growing in usage, it monetizes at a lower rate than our feed and Stories products and we expect it will continue to monetize at a lower rate for the foreseeable future. We also have seen fluctuations and declines in the size of our active user base in one or more regions from time to time. For example, in connection with the war in Ukraine, access to Facebook and Instagram was restricted in Russia and the services were then prohibited by the Russian government, which continued to adversely affect user growth and engagement in the third quarter of 2023. These trends adversely affected advertising revenue in the third quarter of 2023, and we expect will continue to affect our advertising revenue in the foreseeable future.Although we regularly evaluate a variety of sources to understand trends in our advertising revenue, we do not have perfect visibility into the factors driving advertiser spending decisions and our assessments involve complex judgments about what is driving advertising decisions across a large and diversified advertiser base across the globe. Trends impacting advertising spend are also dynamic and interrelated. As a result, it is difficult to identify with precision which advertiser spending decisions are attributable to which trends, and we are unable to quantify the exact impact that each trend had on our advertising revenue during the periods presented.Investment PhilosophyWe expect to continue to build on the discipline and habits that we developed in 2022 when we initiated several efforts to increase our efficiency, while still remaining focused on investing in significant opportunities. In the nine months ended September 30, 2023, 81% of our total costs and expenses were recognized in FoA and 19% were recognized in RL. Our FoA investments include expenses relating to headcount, data centers, and technical infrastructure as part of our efforts to develop our apps and our advertising services. These efforts include significant investments in AI initiatives, including to recommend relevant unconnected content across our products, enhance our advertising tools, develop new products, and develop new features for existing products using generative AI. We are also making significant investments in our metaverse efforts, including developing virtual and augmented reality devices, software for social platforms, neural interfaces, and other foundational technologies for the metaverse. Our RL investments include expenses relating to technology development across these efforts. Many of our RL investments are directed toward long-term, cutting-edge research and development for products for the metaverse that may only be fully realized in the next decade. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, our RL segment reduced our overall operating profit by approximately $11.47 billion, and we expect our RL operating losses to increase meaningfully in 2024. We expect this will be a complex, evolving, and long-term initiative, and our ability to support our metaverse efforts is dependent on generating sufficient profits from other areas of our business. We are investing now because we believe this is the next chapter of the internet and will unlock monetization opportunities for businesses, developers, and creators, including around advertising, hardware, and digital goods.36Table of ContentsTrends in Our Family MetricsThe numbers for our key Family metrics, our DAP, MAP, and average revenue per person (ARPP), do not include users on our other products unless they would otherwise qualify as DAP or MAP, respectively, based on their other activities on our Family products. Trends in the number of people in our community affect our revenue and financial results by influencing the number of ads we are able to show, the value of our ads to marketers, as well as our expenses and capital expenditures. Substantially all of our daily and monthly active people (as defined below) access our Family products on mobile devices.•Daily Active People (DAP). We define a daily active person as a registered and logged-in user of Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and/or WhatsApp (collectively, our ""Family"" of products) who visited at least one of these Family products through a mobile device application or using a web or mobile browser on a given day. We do not require people to use a common identifier or link their accounts to use multiple products in our Family, and therefore must seek to attribute multiple user accounts within and across products to individual people. Our calculations of DAP rely upon complex techniques, algorithms, and machine learning models that seek to estimate the underlying number of unique people using one or more of these products, including by matching user accounts within an individual product and across multiple products when we believe they are attributable to a single person, and counting such group of accounts as one person. As these techniques and models require significant judgment, are developed based on internal reviews of limited samples of user accounts, and are calibrated against user survey data, there is necessarily some margin of error in our estimates. We view DAP, and DAP as a percentage of MAP, as measures of engagement across our products. For additional information, see the section entitled ""Limitations of Key Metrics and Other Data"" in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. --DAP/MAP:------78%-------79%--------79%--------79%---------79%--------79%--------79%--------79%--------79%-----Note: We report the numbers of DAP and MAP as specific amounts, but these numbers are estimates of the numbers of unique people using our products and are subject to statistical variances and errors. While we expect the error margin for these estimates to vary from period to period, we estimate that such margin generally will be approximately 3% of our worldwide MAP. At our scale, it is very difficult to attribute multiple user accounts within and across products to individual people, and it is possible that the actual numbers of unique people using our products may vary significantly from our estimates, potentially beyond our estimated error margins. For additional information, see the section entitled ""Limitations of Key Metrics and Other Data"" in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. In the third quarter of 2022, we updated our Family metrics calculations to maintain calibration of our models against recent user survey data, and we estimate such update contributed an aggregate of approximately 30 million DAP to our reported worldwide DAP in September 2022.Worldwide DAP increased 7% to 3.14 billion on average during September 2023 from 2.93 billion during September 2022.37Table of Contents•Monthly Active People (MAP). We define a monthly active person as a registered and logged-in user of one or more Family products who visited at least one of these Family products through a mobile device application or using a web or mobile browser in the last 30 days as of the date of measurement. We do not require people to use a common identifier or link their accounts to use multiple products in our Family, and therefore must seek to attribute multiple user accounts within and across products to individual people. Our calculations of MAP rely upon complex techniques, algorithms, and machine learning models that seek to estimate the underlying number of unique people using one or more of these products, including by matching user accounts within an individual product and across multiple products when we believe they are attributable to a single person, and counting such group of accounts as one person. As these techniques and models require significant judgment, are developed based on internal reviews of limited samples of user accounts, and are calibrated against user survey data, there is necessarily some margin of error in our estimates. We view MAP as a measure of the size of our global active community of people using our products. For additional information, see the section entitled ""Limitations of Key Metrics and Other Data"" in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Note: We report the numbers of DAP and MAP as specific amounts, but these numbers are estimates of the numbers of unique people using our products and are subject to statistical variances and errors. While we expect the error margin for these estimates to vary from period to period, we estimate that such margin generally will be approximately 3% of our worldwide MAP. At our scale, it is very difficult to attribute multiple user accounts within and across products to individual people, and it is possible that the actual numbers of unique people using our products may vary significantly from our estimates, potentially beyond our estimated error margins. For additional information, see the section entitled ""Limitations of Key Metrics and Other Data"" in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. In the third quarter of 2022, we updated our Family metrics calculations to maintain calibration of our models against recent user survey data, and we estimate such update contributed an aggregate of approximately 40 million MAP to our reported worldwide MAP in September 2022.As of September 30, 2023, we had 3.96 billion MAP, an increase of 7% from 3.71 billion as of September 30, 2022.38Table of Contents•Average Revenue Per Person (ARPP). We define ARPP as our total revenue during a given quarter, divided by the average of the number of MAP at the beginning and end of the quarter. While ARPP includes all sources of revenue, the number of MAP used in this calculation only includes users of our Family products as described in the definition of MAP above. We estimate that the share of revenue from users who are not also MAP was not material. Note: Non-advertising revenue includes RL revenue generated from the delivery of consumer hardware products and FoA Other revenue, which consists of net fees we receive from developers using our Payments infrastructure and revenue from various other sources.During the third quarter of 2023, worldwide ARPP was $8.71, an increase of 16% from the third quarter of 2022.39Table of ContentsTrends in Our Facebook User MetricsThe numbers for our key Facebook metrics, our DAUs, MAUs, and average revenue per user (ARPU), do not include users on Instagram, WhatsApp, or our other products, unless they would otherwise qualify as DAUs or MAUs, respectively, based on their other activities on Facebook.Trends in the number of users affect our revenue and financial results by influencing the number of ads we are able to show, the value of our ads to marketers, as well as our expenses and capital expenditures. Substantially all of our daily and monthly active users (as defined below) access Facebook on mobile devices.•Daily Active Users (DAUs). We define a daily active user as a registered and logged-in Facebook user who visited Facebook through our website or a mobile device, or used our Messenger application (and is also a registered Facebook user), on a given day. We view DAUs, and DAUs as a percentage of MAUs, as measures of user engagement on Facebook.----DAU/MAU:--66%------66%------67%------67%------67%------67%------68%-----68%------68%- --DAU/MAU:--75%-----74%------75%------75%------74%-----75%------74%------75%------75%----DAU/MAU:-73%------72%------73%-----74%------74%------75%------75%------75%------75%-----DAU/MAU:--63%-----63%------64%------64%------64%-----65%------66%------66%------66%----DAU/MAU:-66%------65%------66%-----66%------66%------66%------67%------66%------67%---Note: For purposes of reporting DAUs, MAUs, and ARPU by geographic region, Europe includes all users in Russia and Turkey and Rest of World includes all users in Africa, Latin America, and the Middle East. 40Table of ContentsWorldwide DAUs increased 5% to 2.09 billion on average during September 2023 from 1.98 billion during September 2022. Users in India, Nigeria, and Bangladesh represented the top three sources of growth in DAUs during September 2023, relative to the same period in 2022.•Monthly Active Users (MAUs). We define a monthly active user as a registered and logged-in Facebook user who visited Facebook through our website or a mobile device, or used our Messenger application (and is also a registered Facebook user), in the last 30 days as of the date of measurement. MAUs are a measure of the size of our global active user community on Facebook.   As of September 30, 2023, we had 3.05 billion MAUs, an increase of 3% from September 30, 2022. Users in India, Nigeria, and Bangladesh represented the top three sources of growth in the third quarter of 2023, relative to the same period in 2022.41Table of ContentsTrends in Our Monetization by Facebook User Geography We calculate our revenue by user geography based on our estimate of the geography in which ad impressions are delivered, virtual and digital goods are purchased, or consumer hardware products are shipped. We define ARPU as our total revenue in a given geography during a given quarter, divided by the average of the number of MAUs in the geography at the beginning and end of the quarter. While ARPU includes all sources of revenue, the number of MAUs used in this calculation only includes users of Facebook and Messenger as described in the definition of MAU above. While the share of revenue from users who are not also Facebook or Messenger MAUs has grown over time, we estimate that revenue from users who are Facebook or Messenger MAUs represents the substantial majority of our total revenue. See ""Average Revenue Per Person (ARPP)"" above for our estimates of trends in our monetization of our Family products. The geography of our users affects our revenue and financial results because we currently monetize users in different geographies at different average rates. Our revenue and ARPU in regions such as United States & Canada and Europe are relatively higher primarily due to the size and maturity of those online and mobile advertising markets. For example, ARPU in the third quarter of 2023 in the United States & Canada region was more than 10 times higher than in the Asia-Pacific region.---ARPU:--$10.00---$11.57---$9.54---$9.82---$9.41----$10.86----$9.62----$10.63---$11.23----ARPU:--$52.34--$60.57--$48.29--$50.25---$49.13--$58.77---$48.85---$53.53---$56.11--------ARPU:--$16.50--$19.68--$15.35--$15.64--$14.23---$17.29--$15.51---$17.88---$19.04  -ARPU:--$4.30----$4.89----$4.47----$4.54----$4.42----$4.61----$4.52-----$4.88----$5.12-------ARPU:--$3.14-----$3.43----$3.14----$3.35----$3.21----$3.52----$3.35-----$3.76----$4.22Note: Non-advertising revenue includes RL revenue generated from the delivery of consumer hardware products and FoA Other revenue, which consists of net fees we receive from developers using our Payments infrastructure and revenue from various other sources. 42Table of ContentsOur revenue by user geography in the charts above is geographically apportioned based on our estimation of the geographic location of our users when they perform a revenue-generating activity. This allocation differs from our revenue disaggregated by geography disclosure in Note 2 — Revenue in our condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1, ""Financial Statements"" where revenue is geographically apportioned based on the addresses of our customers.During the third quarter of 2023, worldwide ARPU was $11.23, an increase of 19% from the third quarter of 2022. Over this period, ARPU increased by 34% in Europe, 31% in Rest of World, 16% in Asia-Pacific and 14% in United States & Canada. User growth was mostly in geographies with relatively lower ARPU, such as Asia-Pacific and Rest of World. We expect that user growth in the future will be primarily concentrated in those regions where ARPU is relatively lower, such that worldwide ARPU may continue to increase at a slower rate relative to ARPU in any geographic region in a particular period, or potentially decrease even if ARPU increases in each geographic region.43Table of ContentsComponents of Results of OperationsRevenueFamily of Apps (FoA)Advertising. We generate substantially all of our revenue from advertising. Our advertising revenue is generated by displaying ad products on Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and third-party mobile applications. Marketers pay for ad products either directly or through their relationships with advertising agencies or resellers, based on the number of impressions delivered or the number of actions, such as clicks, taken by users. We recognize revenue from the display of impression-based ads in the contracted period in which the impressions are delivered. Impressions are considered delivered when an ad is displayed to a user. We recognize revenue from the delivery of action-based ads in the period in which a user takes the action the marketer contracted for. The number of ads we show is subject to methodological changes as we continue to evolve our ads business and the structure of our ads products. In particular, the number of ads we show may vary by product (for example, due to the format of our video and Reels products compared to our feed or Stories products), and from time to time we increase or decrease the number or frequency of ads we show as part of our product and monetization strategies. We calculate average price per ad as total advertising revenue divided by the number of ads delivered, representing the average price paid per ad by a marketer regardless of their desired objective such as impression or action. For advertising revenue arrangements where we are not the principal, we recognize revenue on a net basis.Other revenue. Other revenue consists of net fees we receive from developers using our Payments infrastructure and revenue from WhatsApp Business Platform and various other sources.Reality Labs (RL)RL revenue is generated from the delivery of consumer hardware products, such as Meta Quest, wearables, and related software and content.Cost of Revenue and Operating ExpensesCost of revenue. Our cost of revenue consists mostly of expenses associated with the delivery and distribution of our products. These include expenses related to the operation of our data centers and technical infrastructure, such as depreciation expense from servers, network infrastructure and buildings, as well as payroll and related expenses which include share-based compensation for employees on our operations teams, and energy and bandwidth costs. Cost of revenue also includes costs associated with partner arrangements, including traffic acquisition costs and credit card and other fees related to processing customer transactions, and content costs. Additionally, cost of revenue includes RL inventory costs, which consist of cost of products sold and estimated losses on non-cancelable contractual commitments.Research and development. Research and development expenses consist primarily of payroll and related expenses which include share-based compensation, facilities-related costs for employees on our engineering and technical teams who are responsible for developing new products as well as improving existing products, RL technology development costs, and professional services.Marketing and sales. Marketing and sales expenses consist mostly of marketing and promotional expenses as well as payroll and related expenses which include share-based compensation for our employees engaged in sales, sales support, marketing, business development, and customer service functions. Our marketing and sales expenses also include professional services such as content reviewers to support our community and product operations.General and administrative. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of payroll and related expenses which include share-based compensation for certain of our executives as well as our legal, finance, human resources, corporate communications and policy, and other administrative employees; legal-related costs, which include estimated fines, settlements, or other losses in connection with legal and related matters, as well as other legal fees; professional services, and other taxes, such as digital services taxes and other tax levies.44Table of ContentsResults of OperationsThe following table sets forth our condensed consolidated statements of income data (in millions):The following table sets forth our condensed consolidated statements of income data (as a percentage of revenue)(1): ____________________________________(1)    Percentages have been rounded for presentation purposes and may differ from unrounded results.45Table of ContentsRevenueThe following table sets forth our revenue by source and by segment:Family of AppsFoA revenue in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 increased $6.51 billion, or 24%, and $10.96 billion, or 13%, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2022. The increases were driven by advertising revenue.AdvertisingAdvertising revenue in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 increased $6.41 billion, or 24%, and $10.86 billion, or 13%, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2022 due to an increase in the number of ads delivered, partially offset by a decrease in the average price per ad. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the number of ads delivered increased by 31% and 30%, respectively, year-over-year as compared with increases of 17% and 16%, respectively, in the same periods in 2022. Ad impressions grew in all regions during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 as compared to the same periods in 2022, mainly driven by an increase in ads delivered in Asia-Pacific and Rest of World. The increase in ads delivered during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 was driven by increases in the number and frequency of ads displayed across our products and an increase in users. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the average price per ad decreased by 6% and 13%, respectively, year-over-year, as compared with decreases of 18% and 13%, respectively, in the same periods in 2022. The decreases in average price per ad were driven by increases in the number of ads delivered, especially in geographies and in products, such as Reels, that monetize at lower rates. While the average price per ad declined, we believe the improvements to our ad targeting and measurement tools have had a favorable impact on our ad performance and advertising demand. Other factors are also discussed in the section entitled ""—Executive Overview of Third Quarter Results."" In addition, year-over-year advertising revenue growth was driven mainly by marketer spending in online commerce, consumer packaged goods, and gaming while online commerce and gaming benefited from marketers based in China. We anticipate that future advertising revenue will be driven by a combination of price and the number of ads delivered.Reality LabsRL revenue in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 decreased $75 million, or 26%, and $608 million, or 42%, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2022. The decreases in RL revenue were primarily driven by a decrease in the volume of Meta Quest 2 sales.Foreign Exchange Impact on RevenueChanges in foreign exchange rates had a favorable impact on our total revenue and advertising revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2023 compared to the same period in 2022. If we had translated revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2023 using the prior year's monthly exchange rates for our settlement or billing currencies other than the U.S. dollar, our total revenue and advertising revenue would have been $33.50 billion and $33.00 billion, respectively. Using these constant rates, total revenue and advertising revenue would have been $647 million and $645 million lower than actual total revenue and advertising revenue, respectively, for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 46Table of ContentsChanges in foreign exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on our total revenue and advertising revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 compared to the same period in 2022. If we had translated revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 using the prior year's monthly exchange rates for our settlement or billing currencies other than the U.S. dollar, our total revenue and advertising revenue would have been $95.23 billion and $93.67 billion, respectively. Using these constant rates, total revenue and advertising revenue would have been $442 million and $431 million higher than actual total revenue and advertising revenue, respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Cost of revenueCost of revenue in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 increased $494 million, or 9%, and $1.35 billion, or 8%, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2022. The increases were primarily driven by higher operational expenses related to our data centers and technical infrastructure, partially offset by lower content costs. Research and developmentResearch and development expenses in the three months ended September 30, 2023 increased $71 million, or 1%, compared to the same period in 2022. The increase was driven by higher payroll and related expenses, partially offset by lower RL technology development costs.Research and development expenses in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 increased $2.40 billion, or 9%, compared to the same period in 2022. The increase was mostly driven by higher payroll and related expenses and restructuring charges.See Note 3 — Restructuring in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1, of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information regarding restructuring charges.Marketing and salesMarketing and sales expenses in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 decreased $903 million, or 24%, and $1.61 billion, or 15%, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2022. The decreases were primarily due to decreases in marketing and promotional expenses as well as payroll and related expenses. The payroll and related expenses decreased as a result of a 36% decrease in employee headcount from September 30, 2022 to September 30, 2023 in our marketing and sales functions.47Table of ContentsGeneral and administrativeGeneral and administrative expenses in the three months ended September 30, 2023 decreased $1.31 billion, or 39%, compared to the same period in 2022. The decrease was primarily due to legal-related costs.General and administrative expenses in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 increased $388 million, or 4%, compared to the same period in 2022. The increase was mainly due to an increase in restructuring charges, partially offset by lower payroll and related expenses. The payroll and related expenses decreased as a result of a 36% decrease in employee headcount from September 30, 2022 to September 30, 2023 in our general and administrative functions.See Note 3 — Restructuring in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1, of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information regarding restructuring charges.Segment profitabilityThe following table sets forth income (loss) from operations by segment:Family of AppsFoA income from operations in the three months ended September 30, 2023 increased $8.15 billion, or 87%, compared to the same period in 2022. The increase was mostly driven by an increase in advertising revenue and a decrease in costs and expenses. The decrease in costs and expenses was due to decreases in legal-related costs, marketing and sales expenses, and payroll and related expenses, partially offset by an increase in costs related to our data centers and technical infrastructure.FoA income from operations in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 increased $9.86 billion, or 31%, compared to the same period in 2022. The increase was primarily driven by higher advertising revenue, partially offset by an increase in costs and expenses. The increase in costs and expenses was due to increases in costs related to our data centers and technical infrastructure and restructuring charges, partially offset by decreases in marketing and sales expenses as well as payroll and related expenses.Reality LabsRL loss from operations in the three months ended September 30, 2023 increased $70 million, or 2%, compared to the same period in 2022. The increase in loss was mainly due to an increase in payroll and related expenses and a decrease in RL revenue, partially offset by lower RL technology development costs.RL loss from operations in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 increased $2.04 billion, or 22%, compared to the same period in 2022. The increase in loss was mainly due to an increase in payroll and related expenses and a decrease in RL revenue.See Note 3 — Restructuring in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1, of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information regarding restructuring charges.48Table of ContentsInterest and other income (expense), netInterest and other income (expense), net in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 increased $360 million, or 409%, and $129 million, or 103%, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2022. The increases in interest income in both periods were due to a combination of higher interest rates and higher balances, compared to the same periods in 2022. Changes in other income (expense), net were primarily related to gains (losses) recognized for our equity investments.Provision for income taxesOur provision for income taxes in the three months ended September 30, 2023 increased $1.26 billion, or 106% compared to the same period in 2022, due to an increase in income before provision for income taxes, partially offset by a decrease in the effective tax rate. Our provision for income taxes in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 increased $1.42 billion, or 34% compared to the same period in 2022, due to an increase in income before provision for income taxes.Our effective tax rate decreased in the three months ended September 30, 2023 compared to the same period in 2022, primarily due to excess tax benefits recognized from share-based compensation, partially offset by the net effect of additional guidance issued by the IRS providing temporary relief on foreign tax credits and additional clarification regarding research and development expenses subject to mandatory capitalization, and amortization. Our effective tax rate was 18% in both periods for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022.Effective Tax Rate Items. Our effective tax rate in the future will depend upon the proportion between the following items and income before provision for income taxes: U.S. tax benefits from foreign-derived intangible income, tax effects from share-based compensation, research tax credit, tax effects from capital losses not expected to be utilized, restructurings, settlement of tax contingency items, tax effects of changes in our business, and the effects of changes in tax law.The accounting for share-based compensation may increase or decrease our effective tax rate based upon the difference between our share-based compensation expense and the deductions taken on our tax return, which depend upon the stock price at the time of employee award vesting. If our stock price remains constant to the October 20, 2023 price, and absent any changes to U.S. tax law, we expect our effective tax rates for the fourth quarter of 2023 and the full year 2024 to be similar to the third quarter of 2023. This includes the effects of the mandatory capitalization and amortization of research and development expenses incurred in 2023, as required by the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Act). The mandatory capitalization requirement increases our 2023 cash tax liabilities materially but also decreases our effective tax rate due to increasing the foreign-derived intangible income deduction. If the mandatory capitalization is deferred, our effective tax rate in 2023 could be higher when compared to current law and our cash tax liabilities could be several billion dollars lower.See Note 14 — Income Taxes in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1, of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information regarding income tax contingencies.49Table of ContentsLiquidity and Capital ResourcesOur principal sources of liquidity are our cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, and cash generated from operations. Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities are comprised of cash on deposit with banks, time deposits, money market funds, U.S. government and agency securities, and investment grade corporate debt securities. As part of our cash management strategy, we concentrate cash deposits with large financial institutions subject to the strictest regulations and our investment holdings are in diversified highly rated securities. Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were $61.12 billion as of September 30, 2023, an increase of $20.39 billion from December 31, 2022. The increase was mostly due to $51.71 billion of cash generated from operations and $8.46 billion of net proceeds from the issuance of fixed-rate senior unsecured notes (the Notes) in May 2023. These increases were partially offset by $20.20 billion for capital expenditures, including principal payments on finance leases, $13.83 billion for repurchases of our Class A common stock, and $4.79 billion of taxes paid related to net share settlement of employee restricted stock unit (RSU) awards. Cash paid for income taxes was $2.02 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. We deferred $1.56 billion of U.S. federal income tax payments due to the California storms relief provided by the Internal Revenue Service. The deferred amount has been paid in October 2023.During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we repurchased and subsequently retired 72 million shares of our Class A common stock for an aggregate amount of $13.71 billion, including $65 million accrual related to the 1% excise tax as a result of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. As of September 30, 2023, $37.22 billion remained available and authorized for repurchases.The following table presents our cash flows (in millions):Cash Provided by Operating ActivitiesCash provided by operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 mostly consisted of net income adjusted for certain non-cash items, such as $10.60 billion of share-based compensation expense and $8.01 billion of depreciation and amortization expense, as well as $5.11 billion of favorable changes in working capital. The increase in cash flows from operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, compared to the same period in 2022, was mostly due to an increase in cash collection from our customers driven by the increase in revenue, a decrease in payments to our vendors as a result of lower operating spending, and lower cash paid for income taxes.Cash Used in Investing ActivitiesCash used in investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 mostly consisted of $19.45 billion of net purchases of property and equipment as we continued to invest in data centers, servers, and network infrastructure, partially offset by $2.01 billion net proceeds from maturities and sales of marketable debt securities. The decrease in cash used in investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, compared to the same period in 2022, was primarily due to a decrease in purchases of property and equipment.We anticipate making capital expenditures of approximately $27 billion to $29 billion and $30 billion to $35 billion in 2023 and 2024, respectively.50Table of ContentsCash Used in Financing ActivitiesCash used in financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 mostly consisted of $13.83 billion for repurchases of our Class A common stock and $4.79 billion of taxes paid related to net share settlement of RSUs, partially offset by $8.46 billion proceeds from the issuance of the Notes in May 2023. The decrease in cash used in financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, compared to the same period in 2022, was mostly due to a decrease in cash paid for repurchases of our Class A common stock, partially offset by an increase in taxes paid related to net share settlement of employee RSU awards and a decrease in net proceeds from our debt offerings.Material Cash RequirementsWe currently anticipate that our available funds and cash flow from operations and financing activities will be sufficient to meet our operational cash needs and fund our share repurchase program for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. We continuously evaluate our liquidity and capital resources, including our access to external capital, to ensure we can finance our future capital requirements.Leases and Contractual CommitmentsOur operating lease obligations mostly include, among others, offices, data centers, and colocations. Our finance lease obligations include certain network infrastructure. Our facilities consolidation restructuring efforts did not materially change our operating lease obligations.Our contractual commitments are primarily related to our investments in servers, network infrastructure, and consumer hardware products in Reality Labs.Long-term DebtAs of September 30, 2023, we had outstanding long-term debt in the form of senior unsecured notes for an aggregate principal amount of $18.50 billion. These notes were issued in multiple series, which mature from 2027 through 2063. Short-term and long-term future interest payments obligations as of September 30, 2023 are $863 million and $16.62 billion, respectively. Net proceeds from the offerings are used for general corporate purposes, which may include, but are not limited to, capital expenditures, repurchases of outstanding shares of our common stock, acquisitions, or investments.TaxesAs of September 30, 2023, we had taxes payable of $1.50 billion related to a one-time transition tax payable incurred as a result of the Tax Act, of which $936 million is due within one year. As permitted by the Tax Act, we will pay the transition tax in annual interest-free installments through 2025. Our other liabilities also include $6.27 billion related to the uncertain tax positions as of September 30, 2023. Due to uncertainties in the timing of the completion of tax audits, the timing of the resolution of these positions is uncertain and we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments.ContingenciesWe are involved in legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory, tax or government inquiries and investigations. We record a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a liability has been incurred, and that the amount can be reasonably estimated. If we determine there is a reasonable possibility that we may incur a loss and the loss or range of loss can be estimated, we disclose the possible loss in the accompanying notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements to the extent material. Significant judgment is required to determine both probability and the estimated amount of loss. Such matters are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control. Should any of these estimates and assumptions change or prove to be incorrect, it could have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.See Note 8 — Leases, Note 10 — Long-term Debt, Note 12 — Commitments and Contingencies, and Note 14 — Income Taxes in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1, and ""Legal Proceedings"" contained in Part II, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information regarding leases and contractual commitments, debt, taxes, and contingencies.51Table of ContentsCritical Accounting EstimatesOur condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

2023-06-30,"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsYou should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with our condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and with our audited consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In addition to our historical condensed consolidated financial information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates, and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, particularly in Part II, Item 1A, ""Risk Factors."" For a discussion of limitations in the measurement of certain of our community metrics, see the section entitled ""Limitations of Key Metrics and Other Data"" in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.To supplement our condensed consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), we present revenue on a constant currency basis, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. Revenue on a constant currency basis is presented in the section entitled ""—Revenue—Foreign Exchange Impact on Revenue."" To calculate revenue on a constant currency basis, we translated revenue for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 using the prior year's monthly exchange rates for our settlement or billing currencies other than the U.S. dollar.This non-GAAP financial measure is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. This measure may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies, limiting its usefulness for comparison purposes. Moreover, presentation of revenue on a constant currency basis is provided for year-over-year comparison purposes, and investors should be cautioned that the effect of changing foreign currency exchange rates has an actual effect on our operating results. We believe this non-GAAP financial measure provides investors with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business, enables comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance, and allows for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business.Executive Overview of Second Quarter ResultsOur mission is to give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together. Our financial results and key community metrics for the second quarter of 2023 are set forth below. Our total revenue for the second quarter of 2023 was $32.0 billion, an increase of 11% compared to the second quarter of 2022, due to an increase in advertising revenue. Revenue on a constant currency basis would have increased 12% compared to the second quarter of 2022. Ad impressions delivered across our Family of Apps increased 34% year-over-year in the second quarter of 2023, partially offset by a 16% year-over-year decrease in our average price per ad.Income from operations for the second quarter of 2023 was $9.39 billion, an increase of $1.03 billion, or 12%, compared to the second quarter of 2022, due to an increase in advertising revenue, partially offset by increases in costs and expenses such as higher accruals in our ongoing legal proceedings and restructuring charges. 32Table of ContentsConsolidated and Segment ResultsWe report our financial results for our two reportable segments: Family of Apps (FoA) and Reality Labs (RL). FoA includes Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, WhatsApp, and other services. RL includes our augmented and virtual reality related consumer hardware, software, and content.•Net income was $7.79 billion, with diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $2.98 for the three months ended June 30, 2023. •Costs and expenses were $22.61 billion, including accrued legal expenses of $1.87 billion and restructuring charges of $780 million for the three months ended June 30, 2023.•Capital expenditures, including principal payments on finance leases, were $6.35 billion for the three months ended June 30, 2023.•Effective tax rate was 16% for the three months ended June 30, 2023.•Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were $53.45 billion as of June 30, 2023.•Long-term debt was $18.38 billion as of June 30, 2023.•Headcount was 71,469 as of June 30, 2023, a decrease of 14% year-over-year. Approximately half of the employees impacted by the 2023 layoffs are included in our reported headcount as of June 30, 2023. RestructuringIn 2022, we initiated several measures to pursue greater efficiency and to realign our business and strategic priorities. This includes a facilities consolidation strategy to sublease, early terminate, or abandon several office buildings under operating leases, a layoff of approximately 11,000 of our employees across the FoA and RL segments, and a pivot towards a next generation data center design, including cancellation of multiple data center projects. In March 2023, we announced three rounds of planned layoffs to further reduce our company size by approximately 10,000 employees across the FoA and RL segments. In connection with these layoffs, we expect to incur total pre-tax severance and related personnel costs of approximately $1.2 billion, of which $1.12 billion was recognized during the six months ended June 30, 2023.A summary of our restructuring charges for the three months ended June 30, 2023 by major activity type is as follows (in millions):33Table of ContentsDuring the three months ended June 30, 2023, we recorded total restructuring charges of $705 million under our FoA segment, and $75 million under our RL segment. These charges lowered our operating margin by two percentage points, and our diluted EPS by $0.25 for the three months ended June 30, 2023.We expect to incur total pre-tax restructuring charges of approximately $4 billion during the full-year 2023, of which $1.92 billion was recognized during the six months ended June 30, 2023.See Note 3 — Restructuring in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1, of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information regarding restructuring charges.Family of Apps Metrics•Family daily active people (DAP) was 3.07 billion on average for June 2023, an increase of 7% year-over-year.•Family monthly active people (MAP) was 3.88 billion as of June 30, 2023, an increase of 6% year-over-year.•Facebook daily active users (DAUs) were 2.06 billion on average for June 2023, an increase of 5% year-over-year.•Facebook monthly active users (MAUs) were 3.03 billion as of June 30, 2023, an increase of 3% year-over-year.•Ad impressions delivered across our Family of Apps in the second quarter of 2023 increased by 34% year-over-year, and the average price per ad in the second quarter of 2023 decreased by 16% year-over-year.Developments in AdvertisingSubstantially all of our revenue is currently generated from advertising on Facebook and Instagram. We rely on targeting and measurement tools that incorporate data signals from user activity on websites and services that we do not control in order to deliver relevant and effective ads to our users. Our advertising revenue has been, and we expect will continue to be, adversely affected by reduced marketer spending as a result of limitations on our ad targeting and measurement tools arising from changes to the regulatory environment and third-party mobile operating systems and browsers.In particular, legislative and regulatory developments such as the General Data Protection Regulation, including its evolving interpretation through decisions of the Court of Justice of the European Union, ePrivacy Directive, the European Digital Services Act, and U.S. state privacy laws including the California Consumer Privacy Act, as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act, have impacted our ability to use data signals in our ad products, and we expect these and other developments such as the Digital Markets Act will have further impact in the future. As a result, we have implemented, and we will continue to implement, whether voluntarily or otherwise, changes to our products and user data practices, which reduce our ability to effectively target and measure ads. In addition, mobile operating system and browser providers, such as Apple and Google, have implemented product changes and/or announced future plans to limit the ability of websites and application developers to collect and use these signals to target and measure advertising. For example, in 2021, Apple made certain changes to its products and data use policies in connection with changes to its iOS operating system that reduce our and other iOS developers' ability to target and measure advertising, which has negatively impacted, and we expect will continue to negatively impact, the size of the budgets marketers are willing to commit to us and other advertising platforms.To mitigate these developments, we are continually working to evolve our advertising systems to improve the performance of our ad products. We are developing privacy enhancing technologies to deliver relevant ads and measurement capabilities while reducing the amount of personal information we process, including by relying more on anonymized or aggregated third-party data. In addition, we are developing tools that enable marketers to share their data into our systems, as well as ad products that generate more valuable signals within our apps. More broadly, we also continue to innovate our advertising tools to help marketers prepare campaigns and connect with consumers, including developing growing formats such as Reels ads and our business messaging ad products. Across all of these efforts, we are making significant investments in artificial intelligence (AI), including generative AI, to improve our delivery, targeting, and measurement capabilities. Further, we are focused on driving onsite conversions in our business messaging ad products by developing new features and scaling existing features.We are also engaging with others across our industry to explore the possibility of new open standards for the private and secure processing of data for advertising purposes. We believe our ongoing improvements to ad targeting and measurement are continuing to drive improved results for advertisers. However, we expect that some of these efforts will be long-term initiatives, and that the legislative, regulatory and platform developments described above will continue to adversely impact our advertising revenue for the foreseeable future.34Table of ContentsOther Business and Macroeconomic ConditionsOther global and regional business, macroeconomic, and geopolitical conditions also have had, and we believe will continue to have, an impact on our user growth and engagement and advertising revenue. In particular, we believe advertising budgets continue to be pressured by factors such as inflation, rising interest rates, and related market uncertainty, which has led to reduced marketer spending. In addition, competitive products and services have reduced some users' engagement with our products and services. In response to competitive pressures, we are investing in Reels and in AI initiatives across our products, including our AI-powered discovery engine to recommend relevant unconnected content, which we have already seen results in improved user engagement and monetization of our products. While Reels is growing in usage, it monetizes at a lower rate than our feed and Stories products and we expect it will continue to monetize at a lower rate for the foreseeable future. We also have seen fluctuations and declines in the size of our active user base in one or more markets from time to time. For example, in connection with the war in Ukraine, access to Facebook and Instagram was restricted in Russia and the services were then prohibited by the Russian government, which continued to adversely affect user growth and engagement in the second quarter of 2023. These trends adversely affected advertising revenue in the second quarter of 2023, and we expect will continue to affect our advertising revenue in the foreseeable future.Although we regularly evaluate a variety of sources to understand trends in our advertising revenue, we do not have perfect visibility into the factors driving advertiser spending decisions and our assessments involve complex judgments about what is driving advertising decisions across a large and diversified advertiser base across the globe. Trends impacting advertising spend are also dynamic and interrelated. As a result, it is difficult to identify with precision which advertiser spending decisions are attributable to which trends, and we are unable to quantify the exact impact that each trend had on our advertising revenue during the periods presented.Investment PhilosophyWe expect to continue to build on the discipline and habits that we developed in 2022 when we initiated several efforts to increase our efficiency, while still remaining focused on investing in significant opportunities. We expect the majority of our investments in 2023 to be in data center capacity, servers, and network infrastructure supporting our FoAs and RL. In the six months ended June 30, 2023, 81% of our total costs and expenses were recognized in FoA and 19% were recognized in RL. Our FoA investments include expenses relating to headcount, data centers, and technical infrastructure as part of our efforts to develop our apps and our advertising services. These efforts include significant investments in AI initiatives, including to recommend relevant unconnected content across our products, enhance our advertising tools, develop new products, and develop new features for existing products using generative AI. We are also making significant investments in our metaverse efforts, including developing virtual and augmented reality devices, software for social platforms, neural interfaces, and other foundational technologies for the metaverse. Our RL investments include expenses relating to technology development across these efforts. Many of our RL investments are directed toward long-term, cutting-edge research and development for products for the metaverse that may only be fully realized in the next decade. Our RL segment reduced our 2022 overall operating profit by approximately $13.72 billion, and we expect our RL operating losses to continue to increase in 2023 and beyond. We expect this will be a complex, evolving, and long-term initiative, and our ability to support our metaverse efforts is dependent on generating sufficient profits from other areas of our business. We are investing now because we believe this is the next chapter of the internet and will unlock monetization opportunities for businesses, developers, and creators, including around advertising, hardware, and digital goods.35Table of ContentsTrends in Our Family MetricsThe numbers for our key Family metrics, our DAP, MAP, and average revenue per person (ARPP), do not include users on our other products unless they would otherwise qualify as DAP or MAP, respectively, based on their other activities on our Family products. Trends in the number of people in our community affect our revenue and financial results by influencing the number of ads we are able to show, the value of our ads to marketers, as well as our expenses and capital expenditures. Substantially all of our daily and monthly active people (as defined below) access our Family products on mobile devices.•Daily Active People (DAP). We define a daily active person as a registered and logged-in user of Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and/or WhatsApp (collectively, our ""Family"" of products) who visited at least one of these Family products through a mobile device application or using a web or mobile browser on a given day. We do not require people to use a common identifier or link their accounts to use multiple products in our Family, and therefore must seek to attribute multiple user accounts within and across products to individual people. Our calculations of DAP rely upon complex techniques, algorithms, and machine learning models that seek to estimate the underlying number of unique people using one or more of these products, including by matching user accounts within an individual product and across multiple products when we believe they are attributable to a single person, and counting such group of accounts as one person. As these techniques and models require significant judgment, are developed based on internal reviews of limited samples of user accounts, and are calibrated against user survey data, there is necessarily some margin of error in our estimates. We view DAP, and DAP as a percentage of MAP, as measures of engagement across our products. For additional information, see the section entitled ""Limitations of Key Metrics and Other Data"" in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. --DAP/MAP:------79%-------78%--------79%--------79%---------79%--------79%--------79%--------79%--------79%-----Note: We report the numbers of DAP and MAP as specific amounts, but these numbers are estimates of the numbers of unique people using our products and are subject to statistical variances and errors. While we expect the error margin for these estimates to vary from period to period, we estimate that such margin generally will be approximately 3% of our worldwide MAP. At our scale, it is very difficult to attribute multiple user accounts within and across products to individual people, and it is possible that the actual numbers of unique people using our products may vary significantly from our estimates, potentially beyond our estimated error margins. For additional information, see the section entitled ""Limitations of Key Metrics and Other Data"" in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. In the third quarter of 2022, we updated our Family metrics calculations to maintain calibration of our models against recent user survey data, and we estimate such update contributed an aggregate of approximately 30 million DAP to our reported worldwide DAP in September 2022.Worldwide DAP increased 7% to 3.07 billion on average during June 2023 from 2.88 billion during June 2022.36Table of Contents•Monthly Active People (MAP). We define a monthly active person as a registered and logged-in user of one or more Family products who visited at least one of these Family products through a mobile device application or using a web or mobile browser in the last 30 days as of the date of measurement. We do not require people to use a common identifier or link their accounts to use multiple products in our Family, and therefore must seek to attribute multiple user accounts within and across products to individual people. Our calculations of MAP rely upon complex techniques, algorithms, and machine learning models that seek to estimate the underlying number of unique people using one or more of these products, including by matching user accounts within an individual product and across multiple products when we believe they are attributable to a single person, and counting such group of accounts as one person. As these techniques and models require significant judgment, are developed based on internal reviews of limited samples of user accounts, and are calibrated against user survey data, there is necessarily some margin of error in our estimates. We view MAP as a measure of the size of our global active community of people using our products. For additional information, see the section entitled ""Limitations of Key Metrics and Other Data"" in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Note: We report the numbers of DAP and MAP as specific amounts, but these numbers are estimates of the numbers of unique people using our products and are subject to statistical variances and errors. While we expect the error margin for these estimates to vary from period to period, we estimate that such margin generally will be approximately 3% of our worldwide MAP.

For additional information, see the section entitled ""Limitations of Key Metrics and Other Data"" in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. In the third quarter of 2022, we updated our Family metrics calculations to maintain calibration of our models against recent user survey data, and we estimate such update contributed an aggregate of approximately 40 million MAP to our reported worldwide MAP in September 2022.As of June 30, 2023, we had 3.88 billion MAP, an increase of 6% from 3.65 billion as of June 30, 2022.37Table of Contents•Average Revenue Per Person (ARPP). We define ARPP as our total revenue during a given quarter, divided by the average of the number of MAP at the beginning and end of the quarter. While ARPP includes all sources of revenue, the number of MAP used in this calculation only includes users of our Family products as described in the definition of MAP above. We estimate that the share of revenue from users who are not also MAP was not material. Note: Non-advertising revenue includes RL revenue generated from the delivery of consumer hardware products and FoA Other revenue, which consists of net fees we receive from developers using our Payments infrastructure and revenue from various other sources.During the second quarter of 2023, worldwide ARPP was $8.32, an increase of 5% from the second quarter of 2022.38Table of ContentsTrends in Our Facebook User MetricsThe numbers for our key Facebook metrics, our DAUs, MAUs, and average revenue per user (ARPU), do not include users on Instagram, WhatsApp, or our other products, unless they would otherwise qualify as DAUs or MAUs, respectively, based on their other activities on Facebook.Trends in the number of users affect our revenue and financial results by influencing the number of ads we are able to show, the value of our ads to marketers, as well as our expenses and capital expenditures. Substantially all of our daily and monthly active users (as defined below) access Facebook on mobile devices.•Daily Active Users (DAUs). We define a daily active user as a registered and logged-in Facebook user who visited Facebook through our website or a mobile device, or used our Messenger application (and is also a registered Facebook user), on a given day. We view DAUs, and DAUs as a percentage of MAUs, as measures of user engagement on Facebook.----DAU/MAU:--66%------66%------66%------67%------67%------67%------67%-----68%------68%- --DAU/MAU:--75%-----75%------74%------75%------75%-----74%------75%------74%------75%----DAU/MAU:-73%------73%------72%-----73%------74%------74%------75%------75%------75%-----DAU/MAU:--62%-----63%------63%------64%------64%-----64%------65%------66%------66%----DAU/MAU:-65%------66%------65%-----66%------66%------66%------66%------67%------66%---Note: For purposes of reporting DAUs, MAUs, and ARPU by geographic region, Europe includes all users in Russia and Turkey and Rest of World includes all users in Africa, Latin America, and the Middle East. 39Table of ContentsWorldwide DAUs increased 5% to 2.06 billion on average during June 2023 from 1.97 billion during June 2022. Users in India, Nigeria, and Vietnam represented the top three sources of growth in DAUs during June 2023, relative to the same period in 2022.•Monthly Active Users (MAUs). We define a monthly active user as a registered and logged-in Facebook user who visited Facebook through our website or a mobile device, or used our Messenger application (and is also a registered Facebook user), in the last 30 days as of the date of measurement. MAUs are a measure of the size of our global active user community on Facebook.   As of June 30, 2023, we had 3.03 billion MAUs, an increase of 3% from June 30, 2022. Users in India, Nigeria, and Vietnam represented the top three sources of growth in the second quarter of 2023, relative to the same period in 2022.40Table of ContentsTrends in Our Monetization by Facebook User Geography We calculate our revenue by user geography based on our estimate of the geography in which ad impressions are delivered, virtual and digital goods are purchased, or consumer hardware products are shipped. We define ARPU as our total revenue in a given geography during a given quarter, divided by the average of the number of MAUs in the geography at the beginning and end of the quarter. While ARPU includes all sources of revenue, the number of MAUs used in this calculation only includes users of Facebook and Messenger as described in the definition of MAU above. While the share of revenue from users who are not also Facebook or Messenger MAUs has grown over time, we estimate that revenue from users who are Facebook or Messenger MAUs represents the substantial majority of our total revenue. See ""Average Revenue Per Person (ARPP)"" above for our estimates of trends in our monetization of our Family products. The geography of our users affects our revenue and financial results because we currently monetize users in different geographies at different average rates. Our revenue and ARPU in regions such as United States & Canada and Europe are relatively higher primarily due to the size and maturity of those online and mobile advertising markets. For example, ARPU in the second quarter of 2023 in the United States & Canada region was more than 10 times higher than in the Asia-Pacific region.---ARPU:--$10.12---$10.00---$11.57---$9.54---$9.82----$9.41----$10.86----$9.62---$10.63----ARPU:--$53.01--$52.34--$60.57--$48.29---$50.25--$49.13---$58.77---$48.85---$53.53--------ARPU:--$17.23--$16.50--$19.68--$15.35--$15.64---$14.23--$17.29---$15.51---$17.88 -ARPU:--$4.16----$4.30----$4.89----$4.47----$4.54----$4.42----$4.61-----$4.52----$4.88-------ARPU:--$3.05-----$3.14----$3.43----$3.14----$3.35----$3.21----$3.52-----$3.35----$3.76Note: Non-advertising revenue includes RL revenue generated from the delivery of consumer hardware products and FoA Other revenue, which consists of net fees we receive from developers using our Payments infrastructure and revenue from various other sources. 41Table of ContentsOur revenue by user geography in the charts above is geographically apportioned based on our estimation of the geographic location of our users when they perform a revenue-generating activity. This allocation differs from our revenue disaggregated by geography disclosure in Note 2 — Revenue in our condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1, ""Financial Statements"" where revenue is geographically apportioned based on the addresses of our customers.During the second quarter of 2023, worldwide ARPU was $10.63, an increase of 8% from the second quarter of 2022. Over this period, ARPU increased by 14% in Europe, 12% in Rest of World, and 7% in Asia-Pacific and United States & Canada. User growth was mostly in geographies with relatively lower ARPU, such as Asia-Pacific and Rest of World. We expect that user growth in the future will be primarily concentrated in those regions where ARPU is relatively lower, such that worldwide ARPU may continue to increase at a slower rate relative to ARPU in any geographic region in a particular period, or potentially decrease even if ARPU increases in each geographic region.42Table of ContentsComponents of Results of OperationsRevenueFamily of Apps (FoA)Advertising. We generate substantially all of our revenue from advertising. Our advertising revenue is generated by displaying ad products on Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and third-party mobile applications. Marketers pay for ad products either directly or through their relationships with advertising agencies or resellers, based on the number of impressions delivered or the number of actions, such as clicks, taken by users. We recognize revenue from the display of impression-based ads in the contracted period in which the impressions are delivered. Impressions are considered delivered when an ad is displayed to a user. We recognize revenue from the delivery of action-based ads in the period in which a user takes the action the marketer contracted for. The number of ads we show is subject to methodological changes as we continue to evolve our ads business and the structure of our ads products. In particular, the number of ads we show may vary by product (for example, our video and Reels products are monetized at a lower rate than our feed or Stories products), and from time to time we increase or decrease the number or frequency of ads we show as part of our product and monetization strategies. We calculate average price per ad as total advertising revenue divided by the number of ads delivered, representing the average price paid per ad by a marketer regardless of their desired objective such as impression or action. For advertising revenue arrangements where we are not the principal, we recognize revenue on a net basis.Other revenue. Other revenue consists of net fees we receive from developers using our Payments infrastructure and revenue from WhatsApp Business Platform and various other sources.Reality Labs (RL)RL revenue is generated from the delivery of consumer hardware products, such as Meta Quest, wearables, and related software and content.Cost of Revenue and Operating ExpensesCost of revenue. Our cost of revenue consists mostly of expenses associated with the delivery and distribution of our products. These include expenses related to the operation of our data centers and technical infrastructure, such as depreciation expense from servers, network infrastructure and buildings, as well as payroll and related expenses which include share-based compensation for employees on our operations teams, and energy and bandwidth costs. Cost of revenue also includes costs associated with partner arrangements, including traffic acquisition costs and credit card and other fees related to processing customer transactions, and content costs. Additionally, cost of revenue includes RL inventory costs, which consist of cost of products sold and estimated losses on non-cancelable contractual commitments.Research and development. Research and development expenses consist primarily of payroll and related expenses which include share-based compensation, facilities-related costs for employees on our engineering and technical teams who are responsible for developing new products as well as improving existing products, RL technology development costs, and professional services.Marketing and sales. Marketing and sales expenses consist mostly of marketing and promotional expenses as well as payroll and related expenses, which include share-based compensation, for our employees engaged in sales, sales support, marketing, business development, and customer service functions. Our marketing and sales expenses also include professional services such as content reviewers to support our community and product operations.General and administrative. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of payroll and related expenses which include share-based compensation for certain of our executives as well as our legal, finance, human resources, corporate communications and policy, and other administrative employees; legal-related costs, which include estimated fines, settlements, or other losses in connection with legal and related matters, as well as other legal fees; professional services, and other taxes, such as digital services taxes, other tax levies.43Table of ContentsResults of OperationsThe following table sets forth our condensed consolidated statements of income data (in millions):The following table sets forth our condensed consolidated statements of income data (as a percentage of revenue)(1): ____________________________________(1)    Percentages have been rounded for presentation purposes and may differ from unrounded results.44Table of ContentsRevenueThe following table sets forth our revenue by source and by segment:Family of AppsFoA revenue in the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 increased $3.35 billion, or 12%, and $4.45 billion, or 8%, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2022. The increases were driven by advertising revenue.AdvertisingAdvertising revenue in the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 increased $3.35 billion, or 12%, and $4.45 billion, or 8%, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2022 due to an increase in the number of ads delivered, partially offset by a decrease in the average price per ad. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, the number of ads delivered increased by 34% and 30%, respectively, year-over-year as compared with increases of 15% in the same periods in 2022. Ad impressions grew in all regions during the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 as compared to the same periods in 2022, mainly driven by an increase in ads delivered in Asia-Pacific and Rest of World. The increase in ads delivered during the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 was driven by increases in the number and frequency of ads displayed across our products and an increase in users. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, the average price per ad decreased by 16% and 17%, respectively, year-over-year, as compared with decreases of 14% and 11%, respectively, in the same periods in 2022. The decreases in average price per ad were driven by increases in the number of ads delivered, especially in geographies and in products, such as Reels, that monetize at lower rates, and an unfavorable foreign exchange impact. While the average price per ad declined, we believe the improvements to our ad targeting and measurement tools have a favorable impact on our ad performance and advertising demand. Other factors are also discussed in the section entitled ""—Executive Overview of Second Quarter Results."" In addition, year-over-year advertising revenue growth was driven mainly by marketer spending in online commerce, the entertainment and media industries, and consumer packaged goods. We anticipate that future advertising revenue will be driven by a combination of price and the number of ads delivered.Reality LabsRL revenue in the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 decreased $176 million, or 39%, and $530 million, or 46%, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2022. The decreases in RL revenue were primarily driven by a decrease in the volume of Meta Quest sales.Foreign Exchange Impact on RevenueThe general strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to certain foreign currencies for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 compared to the same periods in 2022 had an unfavorable impact on revenue. If we had translated revenue for the three months ended June 30, 2023 using the prior year's monthly exchange rates for our settlement or billing currencies other than the U.S. dollar, our total revenue and advertising revenue would have been $32.27 billion and $31.77 billion, respectively. Using these constant rates, total revenue and advertising revenue would have been $274 million and $269 million higher than actual total revenue and advertising revenue, respectively, for the three months ended June 30, 2023. If we had translated revenue for the six months ended June 30, 2023 using the prior year's monthly exchange rates for our settlement or billing currencies other than the U.S. dollar, our total revenue and advertising revenue would have been $61.73 billion and $60.67 billion, respectively. Using these constant rates, total revenue and advertising revenue would have 45Table of Contentsbeen $1.09 billion and $1.08 billion higher than actual total revenue and advertising revenue, respectively, for the six months ended June 30, 2023. Cost of revenueCost of revenue in the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 increased $753 million, or 15%, and $857 million, or 8%, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2022. The increases were primarily driven by higher operational expenses related to our data centers and technical infrastructure. In the six months ended June 30, 2023, the increase was partially offset by a decrease in content costs. Research and developmentResearch and development expenses in the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 increased $654 million, or 8%, and $2.33 billion, or 14%, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2022. The increases were mainly from higher payroll and related expenses driven by an increase in share-based compensation expenses. To a lesser extent, restructuring charges related to facilities consolidation and severance and other personnel costs also contributed to the increases.See Note 3 — Restructuring in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1, of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information regarding restructuring charges.Marketing and salesMarketing and sales expenses in the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 decreased $441 million, or 12%, and $709 million, or 10%, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2022. The decreases were mostly due to decreases in marketing and promotional expenses as well as payroll and related expenses. The payroll and related expenses decreased as a result of a 20% decrease in employee headcount from June 30, 2022 to June 30, 2023 in our marketing and sales functions.46Table of ContentsGeneral and administrativeGeneral and administrative expenses in the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 increased $1.18 billion, or 39%, and $1.70 billion, or 32%, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2022. The increases were primarily due to accrued legal expenses relating to the fine imposed by the Irish Data Protection Commission in the ongoing data transfers matter and the adoption of new fining guidelines by the European Data Protection Board. In the three months ended June 30, 2023, the increase was partially offset by a decrease in payroll and related expenses as a result of an 11% decrease in employee headcount from June 30, 2022 to June 30, 2023 in our general and administrative functions.See Note 12 — Commitments and Contingencies in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1, of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information regarding legal and related matters.Segment profitabilityThe following table sets forth income (loss) from operations by segment:Family of AppsFoA income from operations in the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 increased $1.97 billion, or 18%, and $1.70 billion, or 8%, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2022. The increases were mainly driven by higher advertising revenue, partially offset by increases in legal-related costs and restructuring charges related to severance and other personnel costs and facilities consolidation.Reality LabsRL loss from operations in the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 increased $933 million, or 33%, and $1.97 billion, or 34%, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2022. The increases were primarily due to decreases in RL revenue, increases in payroll and related expenses, and restructuring charges related to facilities consolidation and severance and other personnel costs. In the three months ended June 30, 2023, the increase in RL loss was also attributed to a prior year reduction in loss reserves on purchase commitments.See Note 3 — Restructuring and Note 12 — Commitments and Contingencies in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1, of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information regarding restructuring charges and legal and related matters, respectively.47Table of ContentsInterest and other income (expense), netInterest and other income (expenses), net in the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 increased $73 million, or 42%, and decreased $232 million, or 109%, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2022. Other income (expense), net was mostly related to gains (losses) recognized for our equity investments.Provision for income taxesOur provision for income taxes in the three months ended June 30, 2023 increased $6 million, compared to the same period in 2022, due to an increase in income before provision for income taxes, partially offset by a decrease in the effective tax rate. Our provision for income taxes in the six months ended June 30, 2023 increased $160 million, or 5% compared to the same period in 2022, due to an increase in the effective tax rate.Our effective tax rate decreased in the three months ended June 30, 2023 compared to the same period in 2022, mostly due to excess tax benefits recognized from share-based compensation and a U.S. tax benefit resulting from a change in foreign tax law, partially offset by a legal accrual that is not expected to be tax-deductible. Our effective tax rate increased in the six months ended June 30, 2023 compared to the same period in 2022, a majority of which was due to a favorable settlement of tax contingencies in 2022 and an increase in interest on tax contingencies and assessments, partially offset by excess tax benefits recognized from share-based compensation.Effective Tax Rate Items. Our effective tax rate in the future will depend upon the proportion between the following items and income before provision for income taxes: U.S. tax benefits from foreign-derived intangible income, tax effects from share-based compensation, research tax credit, tax effects of integrating intellectual property from acquisitions, tax effects from capital losses not expected to be utilized, restructurings, settlement of tax contingency items, tax effects of changes in our business, and the effects of changes in tax law.The accounting for share-based compensation may increase or decrease our effective tax rate based upon the difference between our share-based compensation expense and the deductions taken on our tax return, which depend upon the stock price at the time of employee award vesting. If our stock price remains constant to the July 21, 2023 price, and absent any changes to U.S. tax law, we expect our effective tax rate for the rest of the year to be similar to the second quarter of 2023. This includes the effects of the mandatory capitalization and amortization of research and development expenses incurred in 2023, as required by the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Act). The mandatory capitalization requirement increases our 2023 cash tax liabilities materially but also decreases our effective tax rate due to increasing the foreign-derived intangible income deduction. If the mandatory capitalization is deferred, our effective tax rate in 2023 could be higher when compared to current law and our cash tax liabilities could be several billion dollars lower.See Note 14 — Income Taxes in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1, of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information regarding income tax contingencies.48Table of ContentsLiquidity and Capital ResourcesOur principal sources of liquidity are our cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, and cash generated from operations. Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities are comprised of cash on deposit with banks, time deposits, money market funds, U.S. government and agency securities, and investment grade corporate debt securities. As part of our cash management strategy, we concentrate cash deposits with large financial institutions subject to the strictest regulations and our investment holdings are in diversified highly rated securities. Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were $53.45 billion as of June 30, 2023, an increase of $12.71 billion from December 31, 2022. The increase was mostly due to $31.31 billion of cash generated from operations and $8.46 billion of net proceeds from the issuance of fixed-rate senior unsecured notes (the ""Notes"") in May 2023. These increases were partially offset by $13.44 billion for capital expenditures, including principal payments on finance leases, $10.26 billion for repurchases of our Class A common stock, and $2.70 billion of taxes paid related to net share settlement of employee restricted stock unit (RSU) awards. Cash paid for income taxes was $1.51 billion during the six months ended June 30, 2023. In the second quarter of 2023, we deferred our U.S. federal tax payments due to the California storms relief provided by the Internal Revenue Service. We expect to defer additional federal tax payments in the third quarter of 2023 and our cash payments for income taxes will increase significantly in the fourth quarter of 2023.During the six months ended June 30, 2023, we repurchased and subsequently retired 60 million shares of our Class A common stock for an aggregate amount of $10.01 billion, including $59 million accrual related to the 1% excise tax as a result of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. As of June 30, 2023, $40.91 billion remained available and authorized for repurchases. The following table presents our cash flows (in millions):Cash Provided by Operating ActivitiesCash provided by operating activities during the six months ended June 30, 2023 mostly consisted of net income adjusted for certain non-cash items, such as $7.11 billion of share-based compensation expense and $5.15 billion of depreciation and amortization expense, and $6.00 billion of changes in working capital. The increase in cash flows from operating activities during the six months ended June 30, 2023, compared to the same period in 2022, was primarily due to an increase in cash collection from our customers driven by the increase in revenue and lower cash paid for income taxes. Cash Used in Investing ActivitiesCash used in investing activities during the six months ended June 30, 2023 primarily consisted of $12.96 billion of net purchases of property and equipment as we continued to invest in data centers, servers, and network infrastructure, partially offset by $2.35 billion proceeds from maturities and sales of marketable debt securities. Cash used in investing activities during the six months ended June 30, 2023, increased by $208 million compared to the same period in 2022.We anticipate making capital expenditures of approximately $27 billion to $30 billion in 2023.Cash Used in Financing ActivitiesCash used in financing activities during the six months ended June 30, 2023 primarily consisted of $10.26 billion for repurchases of our Class A common stock and $2.70 billion of taxes paid related to net share settlement of restricted stock units, partially offset by $8.46 billion proceeds from the issuance of the Notes in May 2023. The decrease in cash used in financing activities during the six months ended June 30, 2023, compared to the same period in 2022, was mostly due to the Notes proceeds in May 2023 and a decrease in cash paid for repurchases of our Class A common stock.49Table of ContentsMaterial Cash RequirementsWe currently anticipate that our available funds and cash flow from operations and financing activities will be sufficient to meet our operational cash needs and fund our share repurchase program for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. We continuously evaluate our liquidity and capital resources, including our access to external capital, to ensure we can finance our future capital requirements.Leases and Contractual CommitmentsOur operating lease obligations mostly include, among others, offices, data centers, colocations, and land. Our finance lease obligations include certain network infrastructure. Our facilities consolidation restructuring efforts did not materially change our operating lease obligations. Our contractual commitments are primarily related to our investments in servers, network infrastructure, and consumer hardware products in Reality Labs.Long-term DebtAs of June 30, 2023, we had outstanding long-term debt in the form of senior unsecured notes for an aggregate principal amount of $18.50 billion. These notes were issued in multiple series, which mature from 2027 through 2063. Short-term and long-term future interest payments obligations as of June 30, 2023 are $863 million and $16.82 billion, respectively. Net proceeds from the offerings are used for general corporate purposes, which may include, but are not limited to, capital expenditures, repurchases of outstanding shares of our common stock, acquisitions, or investments.TaxesAs of June 30, 2023, we had taxes payable of $1.50 billion related to a one-time transition tax payable incurred as a result of the Tax Act, of which $936 million is due within one year. As permitted by the Tax Act, we will pay the transition tax in annual interest-free installments through 2025. Our other liabilities also include $6.01 billion related to the uncertain tax positions as of June 30, 2023. Due to uncertainties in the timing of the completion of tax audits, the timing of the resolution of these positions is uncertain and we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments.ContingenciesWe are involved in legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory, tax or government inquiries and investigations. We record a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a liability has been incurred, and that the amount can be reasonably estimated. If we determine there is a reasonable possibility that we may incur a loss and the loss or range of loss can be estimated, we disclose the possible loss in the accompanying notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements to the extent material. Significant judgment is required to determine both probability and the estimated amount of loss. Such matters are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control. Should any of these estimates and assumptions change or prove to be incorrect, it could have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.See Note 8 — Leases, Note 10 — Long-term Debt, Note 12 — Commitments and Contingencies, and Note 14 — Income Taxes in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1, and ""Legal Proceedings"" contained in Part II, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information regarding leases and contractual commitments, debt, taxes, and contingencies.50Table of ContentsCritical Accounting EstimatesOur condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses, and related disclosures.
